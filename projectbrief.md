# Project Brief: B2B Lead Generator

## Overview
A tool for automatically generating B2B leads through web scraping, email verification, and data enrichment.

## Core Objectives
- Automate lead generation for B2B sales
- Extract contact information from relevant websites
- Verify and enrich lead data
- Provide actionable insights for sales teams

## Key Components
1. **Web Scraping Module**: Extract company/contact data from target websites
2. **Email Verification System**: Validate extracted email addresses
3. **Data Enrichment**: Add additional context/information to leads
4. **Lead Management**: Store, categorize, and prioritize leads
5. **Reporting & Analytics**: Track performance metrics

## Technical Context
- Python-based backend
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy/SQLite for data storage
- Streamlit for dashboards/UI (if applicable)
- Integration with third-party verification services

## System Patterns
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Asynchronous processing for performance
- Robust error handling and logging
- Scheduled tasks for automated lead generation
- Rate limiting to avoid IP blocks during scraping
