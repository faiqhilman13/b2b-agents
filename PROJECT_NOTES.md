# Malaysian Lead Generator Project Notes

## Project Overview
The Malaysian Lead Generator is a tool designed to collect business contacts from various Malaysian sources and generate personalized outreach emails. The project is divided into distinct phases:

1. **Lead Collection** - Scraping business contacts from websites
2. **Email Generation** - Creating personalized outreach emails
3. **Email Sending** - Automating the email sending process
4. **Tracking & Analytics** - Monitoring response rates and campaign effectiveness
5. **Maintenance & Utilities** - Tools for system maintenance and cleanup
6. **Security & Compliance** - Ensuring data protection and secure operations
7. **n8n Workflow Automation** - Integration with n8n for workflow automation and UI
8. **Agentive Frontend Integration** - Web-based user interface for the system

## Current Status
We have completed the implementation of Lead Collection (Phase 1), Email Generation (Phase 2), Email Sending functionality (Phase 3), and added Maintenance Utilities (Phase 5). We have significantly enhanced Security (Phase 6) with credential encryption, secure configuration management, enhanced API security, and robust input validation. We have integrated all components into a unified workflow with a comprehensive CLI interface and updated batch scripts.

We have successfully completed the development of the n8n Workflow Automation layer (Phase 7), including a robust API service layer connecting the Python backend with n8n. This integration provides a powerful workflow automation platform for lead management, email outreach, and performance analytics while maintaining the flexibility of our Python backend.

We have enhanced the Email Sending functionality with PDF proposal attachments, allowing users to send personalized proposals with their outreach emails. This includes both a command-line interface and n8n workflow implementation for attaching PDFs from individual files or directories. The latest addition is an intelligent package-based proposal selection system that automatically matches the most appropriate proposal to leads based on their organization type and characteristics.

We have significantly improved the Maintenance & Utilities phase with a comprehensive cleanup system that efficiently manages temporary files, including emails, cache, and logs. This includes a user-friendly batch interface and a robust Python implementation with configurable retention periods.

We have made initial progress on the Agentive Frontend Integration (Phase 8), having established the API foundation and defined database models to support frontend requirements. However, the actual web interface implementation is still pending.

**Recent Security Improvements**: We've significantly enhanced the project's security posture by:
1. Implementing specific CORS configurations instead of wildcards
2. Adding comprehensive rate limiting on the API
3. Creating extensive Pydantic models for input validation and sanitization
4. Improving error handling to prevent information leakage in production
5. Strengthening authentication with more secure token handling

**Important Note:** While the overall workflow functions correctly with test data, we are still encountering significant challenges with the actual web scraping components. These include frequent 403 Forbidden errors, inconsistent HTML parsing, and difficulty extracting contact information from certain websites. Resolving these scraping issues is now our top priority.

   ```
   n8n start
   ```

5. **Import Workflows**
   - Navigate to n8n at http://localhost:5678/
   - Go to Workflows > Import From File
   - Import each workflow JSON file from the n8n_workflows directory
   - Configure credentials for the API connection
